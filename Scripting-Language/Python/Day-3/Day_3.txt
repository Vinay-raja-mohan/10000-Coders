Complex Data Type
  Mixture of a real and a imaginary number for example "2+3j" , "2-3j" , "3j" ,
  We can add , sub ,  divide , multiply

  We can just print the real and imaginary part seperately
        l=2+3j
        print(l.real)  #2.0
        print(l.imag)  #3.0

      imaginary_value = j**2 = -1

String Data Type
  It is a immutable data type
  it is stored between quotation marks
    examples - l = 'vinay'
