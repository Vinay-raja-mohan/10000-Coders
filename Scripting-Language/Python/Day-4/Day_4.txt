Tuple DataType

Tuple is immutable where the values cant be updated or removed or added.
Supports indexing and slicing.

We can declare tuple in the following ways.
j=()
k=tuple()

but is we declaration
j = (20) then this is a int not a tuple () those brackets are not very important , multiple values are those which matter in tuple.
j = (20,) then this is a tuple data type.

Tuples allow Hetrogenous values like a LIST
t = (10,'python',3.2,True,2+3j,[10,20,30]) #tuple
